# opticape
## Download optifine capes using python

Download either the EXE or PY file.

Run the file and follow instructions on screen.
#### *Note: on some python interpreters, like the default IDLE, clearing the screen doesn't work. (Will add functionality to detect this, and instead print blank lines)

The program will save the cape as {UsErNAmE}.png in the same directory you ran the file in. (Case matters)

soon to come: 
<.> GUI in pygame (why not)
<.> More specific error messages
<.> Asyncio requests instead of requests

Tested and developed in python 3.8.3
